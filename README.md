tensorflow error unable to get element as bytes

I think this works with python 2 and 3
and with any recent version of tensorflow,
but returns:

tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InternalError: Unable to get element as bytes.

Will update with fix when I get it.


Run with:

python mlturn1a1ssa.py
